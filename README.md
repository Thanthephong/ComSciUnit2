Planning
----------
The topic is called Martian Decoder. The year is 2050. Planet exploration is a thing, however, communication is still precarious. The station in the Earth can only communicate using Morse code, the station in the Moon can only communicate in Binary code. Communication with the station in Mars must be provided. Basically what we have to do is work with binary and morse programming: provide a communication system that allow stations to communicate seamlessly using English, but the Keyboard input on each station is limited to 2 push buttons.

This is a very new topic for us. Working with binary and morse code, using a different programming language, and working the with arduino set. At first, we were quite anxious but also very excited about getting to build and program a system. And the first thing I did was to get to know how to build the system, get familiar with arduino programming language, and also how too assemble, connect the lights, buttons, resistors to the arduino Uno3 board.

Development
--------

### 1. Practice with traffic light
  This is the first thing we did that is related to arduino. We had to watch a video on youtube on how to build a traffic light for homework, and start building it and coding it by ourselves.
