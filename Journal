Lesson 1: it was really fun during class today. We got to finally finish unit 1 and start with unit 2. 
Our project this time is to make some sort of communication center and use morse code and binary to transfer text between those 
centers. It sounds and look really interesting, especially when we got to open and look at the arduino set for the first time,
and knowing that we will be working with it for this chapter.
