Lesson 1: it was really fun during class today. We got to finally finish unit 1 and start with unit 2. 
Our project this time is to make some sort of communication center and use morse code and binary to transfer text between those 
centers. It sounds and look really interesting, especially when we got to open and look at the arduino set for the first time,
and knowing that we will be working with it for this chapter.


What is the meaning of void?
- Void is the type for the result of a function that returns nothing. Void basically means " no type ", " no valule ", or " empty ".

Types of variables in arduino?
- Char
- Byte
- Int
- Unsigned int
- Long
- unsigned long
- Float
- Double
- String

In the next lesson, after having a test on the variables, we get to start working with buttons and LED lights. At first, I got
quite confused about how to work with the breadboard: where to plug the wires, which wires goes where, where to put the buttons, 
which end is positive, which end is negative. But after doing it multiple times and getting it sorted out, I realized that it 
is actually very easy to know where to connect the wires once you understand how the breadboard works. After that we learned how to use
the serial monitor to check the output of the program.

The serial monitor is very helpful when we want to know what the output will be, and therefore it is very good for debugging problems.
We learnt how to read a button input and from that turn the led lights on and off. We always use Tinkercad - a arduino online
simulator before actually putting the parts together to see if the program is working correctly and there are no errors. The
only disadvantage that we found on tinkercad so far is that we cannot press/hold 2 buttons at the same time, because there is
only 1 cursor. So we have to use the actual physical arduino board in order to test with the cases that involves 2 buttons
being pressed at the same time

We learned about a completely new thing to me today, it is logic gates. At first, me and the rest of the class finds this very 
confusing, probably the most confusing thing for me since the beginning of the year fot this subject. It is very helpful for
working with inputs and outputs when it comes to binary numbers. We did plenty of exercise: drawing graphs, making truth 
tables, applying it to arduino program. Comparing to not using logic gates method, a particular program will contains 
about 35 lines. But when we use logic gates for the same program, we only need about 5 lines to complete it, it is a 
significant difference.
